WBS-CODING EXERCISE

Git Collaborate
In this exercise, you will get to practice setting up a repo to collaborate with your team. You will also get to practice cloning someone else’s repo. This way you will be ready to both create and join coding projects – yay!

 

For your own project follow these steps:

Create an empty repo on Github. Name it “ Your-name-project”
Add your group members as collaborators.
Create an HTML file on your computer with an H1 that says Hello, world!
Add your repo as a remote and push this file to your repo.  
 

This is for your own project. Now on to being a collaborator. Just as you added your group members as collaborators, you should have also been added. So go on to a repo where you have been added as a collaborator, and follow these steps:

 

Clone this repo to your computer. 
Create a new branch called “your-name-branch”
Add a greeting in the HTML file.
Push this branch, with changes, to the remote. (remember to add and commit)
 

If at any point you get stuck, remember that Google is your coding friend. The steps might even contain some useful keywords for a search*hint hint*

 

Good luck
